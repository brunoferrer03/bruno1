Introduction
In 2018, Davide Astori (Italian soccer player) died because
of ventricular fibrillation (a type of arrhythmia) at the age of 31

➢ The reason was a genetic disorder that was not identified
  via traditional medical examinations

Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of death
in athletes, with an incidence of beyond 1 in 80,000 people
per year, according to the most recent estimates

The risk and causes of sudden cardiac death vary based upon the population:

➢ In younger athletes (< 35 years), it is commonly due to inherited cardiac conditions

➢ In older athletes (> 35 years), it is commonly due to coronary artery disease
Introduction
The monitoring of heart activity is fundamental for ensuring that a person does not
present cardiac abnormalities

➢ Acute coronary syndromes, including ischemia and heart attack,
  involve a limitation of the blood flow toward the heart

➢ Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation,
  involve irregularities in the heartbeat cycle


While heart attacks lead to clear symptoms, ischemia and cardiac
arrhythmias may be hard to detect via a single medical test
but requires continuous monitoring of the heart status
Cardiovascular System
The cardiovascular system includes the heart and two
groups of vessels

➢ The arteries carry blood away from the heart

➢ The veins carry blood back to the heart

It is organized into two sub-systems

➢ Systemic circulation makes blood with oxygen
  exit the left heart and reach the rest of the body

➢ Pulmonary circulation makes blood exit the right
  heart and acquire fresh oxygen in the lungs

Cardiovascular System                                                         valve
                                                       Superior
The heart includes four chambers                      Vena Cava                        Pulmonary
                                                                                          valve
➢ Two atria (right and left)
                                                      Right                               Left
➢ Two ventricles (right and left)                    atrium                              atrium

The four chambers alternately contract (systole)
and relax (diastole) to pump blood throughout      Tricuspid                               Mitrial

and depolarization of cardiac muscle cells                                             ventricle

Heart Cycle
Atrial and ventricular diastole

➢ The atria and the ventricles expand
  → atrial filling

Atrial systole (and ventricular diastole)

➢ The atria contract
  → ventricular filling

Ventricular systole (and atrial diastole)

➢ The ventricles contract
  → ventricular ejection

Action Potential
When the heart is at rest, the potential inside of cardiomyocytes is approximately
−𝟗𝟎 𝒎𝑽 with respect to the potential outside the cell membrane

➢ The action potential makes
  the potential inside of
  cardiomyocytes become
  positive with respect to the
  potential outside

➢ After the action potential,
  the potential inside of
  cardiomyocytes returns
  to the resting conditions

Heart Cycle
The depolarization phenomenon associated with action potential makes the
cardiomyocytes contract

➢ The cells of the sinoatrial (SA) node depolarize first and immediately
  triggers the contraction of the atria

➢ The cells of the atrioventricular (AV) node conduct the depolarization
  down a bundle of fibers, named the bundle of His

➢ The cells of the Purkinje fibers enable the contraction of the ventricles,
  which pump the blood out from the heart

There is an inherent delay in this conduction process, making the atria contract
before the ventricles and ensuring the correct heart operation
Heart Cycle
Heart Cycle
We can measure the effect of the heart polarization
and depolarization directly over the skin
by an electrocardiogram (ECG)

1. the P-wave represents the atrial systole,
   i.e., the atrial depolarization

2. the QRS complex represents the ventricular
   systole, i.e., the ventricular depolarization

3. the T-wave represents the ventricular diastole,
   i.e., the ventricular repolarization

Electrocardiogram
➢ When one portion of the heart is polarized and an adjacent
  portion is depolarized, an electrical current moves through the
  cardiac muscle

➢ We can model the heart as an electric dipole in a 3-dimensional
  space, pointing from the biggest mass of depolarized
  myocardium to the biggest mass of polarized myocardium

Electrocardiogram
Despite representing a repolarization phenomenon, the T-wave is upright!

➢ Ventricular depolarization begins in the
  endocardium and spreads toward
  the epicardium while ventricular
  repolarization follows the opposite pattern

➢ The distribution of positive and
  negative charges is the same
  during ventricular depolarization
  and repolarization

                                                                        celle_papir_en/del2/komponenter.html
ECG Acquisition
➢ A single electrode is not sufficient to
  assess the direction and magnitude of
  a 3-dimensional electric dipole

➢ To obtain an accurate representation
  of the cardiac dipole, we need to
  combine measures derived from
  multiple electrodes

   • In an ideal scenario, three
     measures could be enough!
ECG Acquisition
The standard ECG used in medical facilities
is named 12-lead ECG and requires the
placement of 9 surface-skin electrodes

➢ 3 electrodes on the patient limbs
  enable the recording of the limb leads
  → 𝐼, 𝐼𝐼, 𝐼𝐼𝐼, 𝑎𝑉𝑅, 𝑎𝑉𝐹, 𝑎𝑉𝐿

➢ 6 electrodes on the patient chest
  enable the recording of the precordial
  leads → 𝑉1, 𝑉2, 𝑉3, 𝑉4, 𝑉5, 𝑉6
Limb Leads
Leads 𝐼, 𝐼𝐼 and 𝐼𝐼𝐼 are called limb leads and point the extrema
of the so-called Einthoven’s triangle

➢ Lead 𝐼 is the potential difference between left arm (LA) and
  the right arm (RA) → 𝐼 = 𝐿𝐴 − 𝑅𝐴                                      𝐼

➢ Lead 𝐼𝐼 is the potential difference between left leg (LL) and
  the right arm (RA) → 𝐼𝐼 = 𝐿𝐿 − 𝑅𝐴
                                                                            𝐼𝐼𝐼
➢ Lead 𝐼𝐼𝐼 is the potential difference between left leg (LL) and
  the left arm (LA) → 𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝐿𝐿 − 𝐿𝐴                                𝐼𝐼


We call common lead or Wilson’s central terminal the
average potential across the human body

                    𝑉𝑊 = (𝑅𝐴 + 𝐿𝐴 + 𝐿𝐿)Τ3
Augmented Limb Leads
Leads 𝑎𝑉𝑅, 𝑎𝑉𝐿 and 𝑎𝑉𝐹 are called augmented limb leads
and are a linear combination of the limb leads

➢ 𝑎𝑉𝑅 is the potential difference between the right arm (RA)
  and the average potential of left arm (LA) and left leg (LL)         𝐼
  → 𝑎𝑉𝑅 = 𝑅𝐴 − (𝐿𝐴 + 𝐿𝐿)Τ2

➢ 𝑎𝑉𝐿 is the potential difference between the left arm (LA) and
  the average potential of right arm (RA) and left leg (LL)                𝐼𝐼𝐼
  → 𝑎𝑉𝐿 = 𝐿𝐴 − (𝑅𝐴 + 𝐿𝐿)Τ2
                                                                  𝐼𝐼
➢ 𝑎𝑉𝐹 is the potential difference between the left leg (LL) and
  the average potential of right arm (RA) and left arm (LA)
  → 𝑎𝑉𝐹 = 𝐿𝐿 − (𝑅𝐴 + 𝐿𝐴)Τ2
Precordial Leads
➢ 𝑉1 is placed to the right of the sternal border

➢ 𝑉2 is situated to the left of the sternal border

➢ 𝑉3 is placed between 𝑉2 and 𝑉4

➢ 𝑉4 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal
  space in the mid-clavicular line

➢ 𝑉5 is placed between 𝑉4 and 𝑉6

➢ 𝑉6 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal
  space in the mid-axillary line

                                   precordial leads 𝑉7, 𝑉8, 𝑉9

Cardiac Arrhythmias

From the RR intervals, measured in second [s], we can assess the heart rate of a
person, which is usually given in beat per minute [bpm]

                              𝐻𝑅(𝑡) = 60ൗ𝑅𝑅(𝑡) [bpm]

During resting condition, the HR is in the range between 60 and 100 𝑏𝑝𝑚

➢ Lower HR values are associated with bradycardia

➢ Higher HR values are associated with tachycardia

Looking at the morphology of the ECG signal, it is possible to diagnose specific types
of cardiac arrhythmias

Acute Coronary Syndromes
Cardiac arrhythmias are caused by malfunctions in the propagation of the electric
signal within the heart muscle

More critical conditions are associated with acute coronary syndromes, which involve
a reduction of the blood flow to the myocardium

➢ If the coronary arteries are partially blocked,
  we have a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction

➢ If the coronary arteries are completely blocked,
  we have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction

➢ If it is not detected promptly, myocardial infarction
  makes the heart stop beating and, consequently,
  causes the death of the person

ECG Processing Pipeline
A single-lead ECG can be easily recorded via a wearable or minimally invasive device

➢ This enables the continuous monitoring of the patient, which is fundamental for
  detecting disorders that do not present prominent symptoms

➢ This does not allow us to build a full picture of the cardiac dipole, which is three-
  dimensional and, thus, requires at least three electrical measures

ECG Processing Pipeline
ECG signals (both single- or multi-lead) have a bandwidth ranging from 50 𝐻𝑧 (commercial
applications) to 100 𝐻𝑧 (medical applications), and may reach values of 5.0 𝑚𝑉

➢ The sampling frequency 𝑓𝑠 must be higher than 100 𝐻𝑧, a value raised up
  to 500 𝐻𝑧 in medical scenarios

➢ The resolution value must be lower than 0.01 𝑚𝑉 while the saturation value
  must be higher than 5.0 𝑚𝑉

➢ The raw ECG signal is characterized by a direct current (DC) component
  of ±300 𝑚𝑉, which must be removed before processing the data
ECG Processing Pipeline
To pre-process an ECG signal, we need to execute three main tasks

➢ Denoising to eliminate power line interference and the artifacts caused by other sources
  but the cardiac muscle (e.g., respiration)

➢ Peak detection to identify the QRS peak and, consequently, compute the Heart Rate (HR)
  and/or the Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

➢ Segmentation to split the signal into windows, each representing a cardiac cycle, and
  extract morphological signal features
Denoising




  ➢ Respiration and movements lead to low-frequency (slow-changing) interferences
    that can be removed via a high-pass filter (with 0.5 𝐻𝑧 as a cutoff frequency)
Denoising




  ➢ Muscles lead to high-frequency (fast-changing) interferences that can be removed via
    a low-pass filter (with 20 𝐻𝑧 as a cutoff frequency)
Powerline Interference
Physiological signals recorded from the human body, including ECG and EEG, suffer the
electromagnetic interference of the recording devices, which are supplied with a 50 𝐻𝑧 (or
60 𝐻𝑧, depending on the country) electric current

➢ It is important to remove the powerline

➢ In electrocardiography, this is not a critical
  issue since ECG information are contained
  in frequencies lower than 50 Hz
QRS Peak Detection
A common method for detecting the QRS peak is the Pan-Tompkins algorithm

➢ Apply a band-pass filter to remove the components outside of the 5 − 15 𝐻𝑧
  frequency range

Morphological Features
Beyond the RR intervals (and, thus, the heart rhythm) we may compute

➢ The PR interval, which denotes
  the time from the beginning of the
  atrial contraction to the beginning of
  the ventricular contraction, normally
  ranging from 0.12 𝑠 to 0.20 𝑠

➢ The QRS complex, which denotes
  the ventricular contraction, normally
  ranging from 0.06 𝑠 to 0.10 𝑠
Morphological Features
Beyond the RR intervals (and, thus, the heart rhythm) we may compute

➢ The ST interval, which denotes the
  period during which the ventricles
  are contracted and pump the blood
  through the body, normally ranging
  from 0.08 𝑠 to 0.12 𝑠

➢ the QT interval, which denotes the
  time from the beginning of the
  ventricular contractions to the full
  relaxation of the heart, normally
  ranging from 0.35 𝑠 to 0.45 𝑠

Heart Rate Variability
A useful biomarker of heart status is Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which denotes the
tendency of the RR intervals to fluctuate in time

➢ Fluctuations of the RR interval in time are an indicator of a healthy individual, while a low
  HRV is a sign of health problems since it denotes that the patient has a high heart rate
  at rest or cannot adapt the heart rate to changing situations

  HRV is a sign of health problems since it denotes that the patient has a high heart rate

HRV can be estimated in a time-dependent fashion, i.e., by selecting a time window 𝑇 and
computing the feature 𝐻𝑅𝑉(𝑡) according to all the RR intervals measured between time
𝒕 and time 𝒕 + 𝑻

➢ The selection of 𝑇 trades off between estimation accuracy and time sensitivity → A value
  of at least 𝑇 = 4 min is recommended to have reliable measures!
Heart Rate Variability
We model the RR intervals associated with an ECG signal as a time series, and we denote
by 𝑅𝑅𝑖 the 𝑖-th element of the series

We segment the series into windows, each lasting 𝑇 seconds, and denote by 𝒩(𝑡) the
indexes of the RR intervals detected from time 𝑡 to time 𝑡 + 𝑇 and by 𝒩(𝑡) the size of 𝒩(𝑡)

We segment the series into windows, each lasting 𝑇 seconds, and denote by 𝒩(𝑡) the
indexes of the RR intervals detected from time 𝑡 to time 𝑡 + 𝑇 and by 𝒩(𝑡) the size of 𝒩(𝑡)

➢ The average 𝐴𝑉𝑅𝑅 𝑡 and the standard deviation 𝑆𝐷𝑅𝑅(𝑡) of the RR intervals from time
  𝑡 and time 𝑡 + 𝑇 represent two estimates of the HR and the HRV at time 𝑡

                        σ𝑖∈𝒩(𝑡) 𝑅𝑅𝑖                   σ𝑖∈𝒩(𝑡) 𝑅𝑅𝑖 − 𝐴𝑉𝑅𝑅(𝑡)   2
             𝐴𝑉𝑅𝑅 𝑡 =                 ,   𝑆𝐷𝑅𝑅(𝑡) =
                           𝒩(𝑡)                                 𝒩(𝑡)

From the series of RR intervals, we can compute the series of subsequent RR interval
differences as 𝑆𝐷𝑖 = 𝑅𝑅𝑖+1 − 𝑅𝑅𝑖

We denote by ℳ(𝑡) the indexes of the RR interval differences detected from time 𝑡 to time
𝑡 + 𝑇 and by ℳ(𝑡) the size of ℳ(𝑡)

➢ We can estimate the HRV at time 𝑡 by the following metrics

                                                                                   2
                        σ𝑖∈ℳ(𝑡) 𝑆𝐷𝑖                      σ𝑖∈ℳ   𝑡   𝑆𝐷𝑖 − 𝐴𝑉𝑆𝐷 𝑡
            𝐴𝑉𝑆𝐷 𝑡 =                  ,   𝑆𝐷𝑅𝑅 𝑡 =                                     ,
                          ℳ(𝑡)                                       ℳ 𝑡

                                              σ𝑖∈ℳ       𝑆𝐷𝑖   2
                                                     𝑡
                                 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐷(𝑡) =
                                                  ℳ 𝑡

Another HRV estimate is the probability (ppRR𝜏) that consecutive RR intervals differ more
than 𝝉 milliseconds, where 𝜏 is usually set to 50 𝑚𝑠 or 20 𝑚𝑠

                                           σ𝑖∈ℳ   𝑡   𝜒(𝑆𝐷𝑖 > 𝜏)
                              𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝜏(𝑡) =
                                                  ℳ 𝑡

                                             1  𝑆𝐷𝑖 > 𝜏
                               𝜒 𝑆𝐷𝑖 > 𝜏 = ቊ
                                            0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒

Both RMSD and ppNN𝜏 are considered markers of the vagal (i.e., parasympathetic) tone of
the autonomic nervous system
Heart Rate Variability
We can implement a short-time Fourier transform and analyze the spectral density of the
RR interval series, considering 𝑇 as the windowing period

➢ RR intervals are irregular in time (unless you have a perfectly periodic rhythm) → Before
  implementing the transform, we need to interpolate the series!

After the interpolation, we obtain a series of equidistant samples in the time domain, as in
the case of a discrete-time signal 𝑥[∙]

                                      𝑅𝑅[𝑛],     𝑛 ∈ ℤ+

Heart Rate Variability
Given the spectral density ℛℛ[𝑘, 𝑛] of the RR intervals at sample 𝑛, we can compute the
energy of significant frequency bands:

➢ the low-frequency (LF) band 0.06, 0.10 𝐻𝑧 reflects both the sympathetic and the vagal
  (i.e., parasympathetic) tones of the autonomic nervous system

➢ the high-frequency (HF) band [0.15, 0.40] 𝐻𝑧 reflects the vagal (i.e., parasympathetic)
  tones of the autonomic nervous system

The energy ratio 𝐸𝑅 𝑡 = 𝐸𝐿𝐹 𝑡 ൗ𝐸𝐻𝐹     𝑡   between 𝐸𝐿𝐹 𝑡 and 𝐸𝐻𝐹 𝑡 is considered a marker of
the sympathetic–vagal balance
